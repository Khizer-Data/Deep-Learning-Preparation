### Basic Idea:

A perceptron takes several inputs, applies weights to them, sums them up, and passes the result through an **activation function** (usually a step function) to produce a binary output (0 or 1).

</div>

A **perceptron** is the simplest type of artificial neural network, and it's used for **binary classification** tasks. It was first introduced by **Frank Rosenblatt in 1958**.

### Formula:

Given inputs $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ and weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$, the perceptron computes:

$$
y = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

* $b$ is the **bias**
* $y$ is the **output**

### Key Concepts:

* **Weights** are learned during training.
* It uses the **perceptron learning rule** to adjust weights.
* Works only for **linearly separable** data.

### 1. **Weights (w)** 🏋️‍♂️
- **What?** Numbers set at the start to weigh each input’s importance.
- **Initialization**: Randomly set, often in range **[-1, 1]** or **[-0.1, 0.1]** for small steps.
- **Auto-Update**: Adjusted during learning to reduce errors using the learning rule.
- **Think of it like**: Tuning how much each input “matters.”

---

### 2. **Bias (b)** ⚖️
- **What?** A constant also set at the start to shift the decision boundary.
- **Initialization**: Often set to **0** or a small random value like **[-0.1, 0.1]**.
- **Auto-Update**: Tweaked automatically with the learning rule.
- **Think of it like**: A nudge to get the prediction just right.
- **Why?** Makes the perceptron flexible to fit data better.

---

### 3. **Perceptron Learning Rule** 📚
- **What?** The recipe to automatically update weights and bias when predictions are wrong.
- **How?** If predicted output \( \hat{y} \) ≠ actual output \( y \):
  - Weight update: \( w_i \gets w_i + \eta (y - \hat{y}) x_i \)
  - Bias update: \( b \gets b + \eta (y - \hat{y}) \)
- **Think of it like**: Fixing the recipe after a bad cake! 🥮
- **Auto?** Yes! Updates happen every time the perceptron learns.

---

### 4. **Learning Rate (η)** ⚙️
- **What?** A small number (e.g., **0.01** or **0.001**) that controls how much weights and bias change.
- **Why Small?** Small steps prevent overshooting the best solution, ensuring steady learning.
- **Think of it like**: Fine-tuning a radio dial to get the perfect signal. 🎛️
- **Why Important?** Too big (e.g., 1.0) = wild jumps, missing the target. Too small (e.g., 0.0001) = super slow learning.
- **Typical Range**: **0.001 to 0.1**, tweaked to optimize results.

---

### 5. **Activation Function** 🚀
- **What?** A function that decides whether the perceptron should output 0 or 1.
- **Common Choices**: Step function (0 or 1), Sigmoid function (0 to 1), ReLU (rectified linear unit).
- **Think of it like**: A switch that decides if the cake is good or not.
- **why?** To make the perceptron learn complex patterns.
- **Step Function** is a simple one:
  - If \( z \) is positive, output 1.
  - If \( z \) is negative or zero, output 0.
- **Example**: If \( z = 0.5 \), the step function outputs 1.

🖼️ How It Works

Start: Initialize random weights (e.g., between -0.1 and 0.1) and bias (e.g., 0).
Process: Multiply each input (x1, x2, ...) by its weight, sum them, and add the bias:z = (w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + ...) + b


Predict: Pass z through an activation function (like a yes/no switch) to get the output ŷ.
Learn: If ŷ is wrong, the learning rule updates weights and bias using the learning rate to reduce errors.
Repeat: Keep predicting and learning until the perceptron is good at classifying.

---

### Advantages:

* Simple to understand and implement.
* Works well for linearly separable data.


### Limitations:

* Cannot solve problems like XOR (non-linearly separable).

Great! Let’s go step-by-step:

---

### **1. XOR & Non-Linearity**

The **XOR (exclusive OR)** logic is:

| Input A | Input B | Output A XOR B |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| 0       | 0       | 0              |
| 0       | 1       | 1              |
| 1       | 0       | 1              |
| 1       | 1       | 0              |

Now plot these points:

* (0, 0) → 0
* (0, 1) → 1
* (1, 0) → 1
* (1, 1) → 0

There is **no single straight line** that can separate the output classes (0 vs. 1) — this is what we mean by **non-linear**. The **basic perceptron fails** to solve this.


* This led to the development of **multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)** and **deep neural networks**, which overcome these limitations.
